# Code Instruction 
* Use Android Studio to open code project.(Note: Since the large file(100 files)limitation, I only upload the main code which includes manifest.xml, java code, layout code).
* Run Android Virtual Device.
* Run code in AVD directly.
* Follow [demo](https://github.com/lelelulu/Ordering-System/wiki#app-demo) to use this app.
